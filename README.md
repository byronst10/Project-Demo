**Description:**
<br>
A motivational study app which enables users to keep track of their daily study times. The aim of this app is to
aid users in improving their time-management and increase their overall productivity. An interactive timer is provided along with motivational quotes that are generated each time the stop button is clicked.
<br>

**Additional features for future development:**
1. Storing users' study time in Firebase database, while incorporating a Charts JS feature to keep track of
   study progress throughout the week (similar to "screen time" on the iPhone).
2. Making the App mobile responsive.
